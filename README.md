# Canvas Genealogy
This plugin aims to fill a gap in the current genealogy software market. As there's a very limited availabiliy of *free and simple* tools for family tree building, I set out to create one of my own.

The project isn't simple by any means, since I have no previous TypeScript experience, nor am I familiar with Obsidian plugin development environment, therefore this is a WIP (Work In Progress).

## Features (planned)
- Interactive building of family tress in Canvas
- Conversion of `.ged` genealogical data files to `.json` that Canvas can understand
